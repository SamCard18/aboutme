        <h3>About me</h3>

        <p>
                Born June 6,1998 in BC but shortly after we moved to Harrow ON where I have been the rest of my
                life. My family consists of four people Linda my mom, Eric my dad and my older sister Taylor.
                We also have a loving and very funny dog Patches. 
                I went to grade school in Harrow and I went to Villanova for high school. A few thing about me, 
                I was a competitive swimmer most of my life then coached the Harrow Electric Eels Team ( H.E.E.A.T ) for 4 years. I
                also work as a lifeguard at Regional Childrens Center ( RCC ) in Windsor 

        </p>

        <p class="white-copy">
        Now I am in my 2nd year of Graphic Desgin at St. Clair college. In 5 - 10 year I hope to be working
        In a company as a Graphic Desginer or I would also like to have my own Photography studio
